# Decisions

## Public name

Use only `herdr-picker-plus` / `Herdr Picker Plus`.
Do not use old plugin ids, old binary names, or personal prefixes.

## Minimum release quality

Keep these files:
- README
- LICENSE
- CHANGELOG
- SECURITY
- CONTRIBUTING
- RELEASE
- GitHub CI/release workflows
- issue/PR templates

But do not add enterprise boilerplate beyond that.

## No new dependencies for picker UX

The plugin is itself a Rust TUI. Do not depend on `fzf`, `tv`, etc.
`zoxide` is optional because it is a data source, not UI.

## Herdr Plus dependency stays optional

If Herdr Plus config dirs are absent, project/quick sources should degrade quietly.
No hard failure on missing Herdr Plus.

## Theme implementation is local mapping

Known limitation: Herdr plugin v1 does not provide active theme palette.
Local mapping + custom override is the accepted solution for now.

## Simplicity bias

This project should stay a compact plugin. Avoid speculative abstractions, plugin SDK wrappers, or multi-file refactors unless code size starts blocking safe changes.

## Integration contract v1

Use a command/JSON list-open contract before building a plugin SDK. This keeps contributor burden low and avoids a speculative framework. Herdr Plus remains built in because it needs Herdr-specific workspace/tab bootstrap behavior.

Picker Plus owns notifications for integration open success/failure so plugin authors only implement list/open.

## Agent search feature shape

Use visible Herdr state first: agent name, workspace label/id, cwd, pane/tab/terminal ids, status. Add token filters for precision and aliases for user memory. Do not invent session names inside Picker Plus; aliases are search-only.

`#` is reserved for agents needing user action (blocking/done/review/request/error). `@` without text shows other agents; `@text` still matches workspace/session label/id and also status text for fast navigation.
