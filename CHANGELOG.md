# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Command/JSON plugin integration contract via `[[integrations]]`.
- Herdr success/error notifications for selected actions.
- Agent search by agent name, workspace/session label, cwd/path, status, ids, and aliases.
- Agent shortcut: `@` as a Ctrl-A-style full agent view with configurable sorting.
- Server source from `~/.ssh/config` and manual `[[servers.entries]]`, with `Ctrl-S` filtering.

### Changed

- Agent rows stay tied to the pane start directory while still searching current foreground cwd.

- Picker entries dispatch through actions instead of hardcoding behavior by source.
